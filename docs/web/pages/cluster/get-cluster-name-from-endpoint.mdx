title: 'Cluster | Solutils'

Returns the cluster name from any endpoint. This is especially useful when you want to know which cluster the user is on when they are using a custom endpoint.

```typescript {1,3}
import { getClusterNameFromEndpoint } from '@lndgalante/solutils';

const { clusterName } = await getClusterNameFromEndpoint('https://solana-api.projectserum.com');

console.log(clusterName); // "mainnet-beta"
```
